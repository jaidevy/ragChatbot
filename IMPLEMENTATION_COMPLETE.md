#### ðŸ§ª Test Commands:
```bash
# Test memory system
python test_memory_system.py

# Interactive demo
python manage.py demo_memory --user testuser

# Initialize memory for existing users
python manage.py init_memory

# Clean up old memories
python manage.py cleanup_memories
```

### ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Message Processing**: When a user sends a message, the system:
   - Analyzes importance using NLP techniques
   - Extracts entities and intent
   - Stores relevant information as memories
   - Updates conversation context

2. **Context Building**: Before generating responses, the AI:
   - Retrieves relevant long-term memories
   - Gets recent short-term context
   - Considers user personality preferences
   - Builds comprehensive context for personalized responses

3. **Memory Management**: The system automatically:
   - Promotes important short-term memories to long-term storage
   - Cleans up expired and low-importance memories
   - Updates conversation summaries
   - Maintains optimal memory performance

### ðŸ”® Enhanced AI Responses

The chatbot now provides:
- **Personalized Communication**: Adapts to user's preferred style
- **Contextual Awareness**: References previous conversations
- **Intelligent Recall**: Remembers important user information
- **Learning Capability**: Improves responses over time
